                        To see your cards you must tilt your device up as if you were looking at real cards, you may only look at your cards during, your turn. Try not to tilt the device too far as this will enable the peeking mechanism of the game. And watch out because the
                        better you cards the more likely of accidentally showing your cards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On any turn which is not yours you are only allowed to attempt a peek. This is a mechanism which allows you to see another players cards if they tilt their FPGA too far. Try not too peek too much as every peek makes it more likely for your cards to be
                        revelaed on your next turn.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Look above for you legal moves. You can find the key mappings for each of the possible moves on the diagram on the right. In the event of a raise or a bet, to select the ammount being raised or bet, move the 8 key up, then tilt the device to select the
                        value for the particular digit, once the first deigit is selected move the 5 key up to lock that digit. Repeat this step for every digit.
