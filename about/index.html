Python, Java, C, C++, C# and anything I could get my hands on. You can find a link to all my projects in the projects tab or on GitHub.

                <p>
                    I am currently starting my second year of undergraduate studies in Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE) at Imperial College London. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my first year at Imperial I achieved a "first” and was awarded a spot on the Dean’s list 2019/20, meaning I scored in the top 10% of students in my cohort. Furthermore, my final group project (a circuit simulator built from the ground up) earned an award for best first year project; read more about it with the link bellow.

                    As an Imperial EIE student, my course focuses on teaching the fundamentals of computer-architecture, and low-level programming. In first year, I learned how to build a simple CPU design from scratch, as well as how to write programs for it.
                </p>
                <h2>Highschool (IB Diploma)</h2>
                <p>
                    The International Baccalaureate (IB) diploma is a highschool diploma, acknowledged ny many to be one
                    of the most rigorous international highschool diplomans out there. I studied 4 courses at higher level
                    (HL), this level covers university level material. The HL courses were Math, Physics, Chemistry, and
                    Economics. I received the scores of 7, 7, 7, and 6 respectfully for each of the courses, where 7 is the
                    highest mark achievable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At standard level (SL), a slightly lower level, pre-university level material, I studied English Language
                    and Literature, and Spanish Language and Literature. This allowed me to receive a bi-lingual diploma
                    acknowledging my fluency in both English and Spanish. I received a 6, and a 5 respectfully for the courses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall my diploma ended up with 40 points, with a maximum of 45 points. This includes the course points,
                    as well as 2 of 3 points for the core IB programme, Theory of Knowledge (TOK), Creativity Activity Service
                    (CAS), and the Extended Essay (EE). TOK is a course about learning to learn, it encourages you to explore
                    what exactly knowledge is, and acts as a semi philosophy course. CAS is a requirement by the IB, to engage
                    not only in academics, but to do an Active, a Service, and a Creative activity through the program.
                    Finally the EE, is a 4000 word investigation into a subject of choice. I chose chemistry, and explored
                    how different processes could increase the efficiency of the production of hydrogen through electrolysis.

                    In 2018 I interned at OESIA a multi-national corporation based in Madrid, Spain. I was tasked with automating an identification system for employees whose work could potentially apply for government sanctioned tax-breaks for the company. The system I crafted allowed for easy collection of data to prove that the employee did in fact apply for these tax-breaks in the event of an audit. OESIA had a heavy focus on innovation. At the time the Spanish government had recently lowered the social-security taxes for companies who pursued technological innovation. The system I crafted helped the company take advantage of this. 
                </p>
                <div class="auto-margin uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body uk-width-1-2@s uk-width-1-3@m uk-width-1-4l">

                </div>
                <p>
                    Using a combination of data from human resources, employee work hours, project lists, etc. I devised a system which would identify known employees who had already been marked as able to take advantage of the new law. Additionally, through extrapolation the system was able to find projects which could be considered "innovative" and generate a list of potential candidates. This system then decreased the list of potential candidates and sorted these from most-likely to apply to least likely. This list contained all of the information gathered, making it very easy for whomever had to manually vet the list. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once in the system, automated emails would be sent to those who were deemed able to apply for the tax cuts requesting evidence of their work. A small amount of checking was automated to ensure that the information was valid, however, all information had to be vetted by qualified personnel to ensure that there was valid evidence of innovation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately, in accordance with company policies, I was not able to keep a copy of the code for this project.

                    In 2017 I interned at Borro, a London based financial start-up working with high value asset based lending. I was employed to run an experiment using blockchain as a potential new financial ledger for the company. This technology would allow for the creation of permanent financial records for the company. This would increase trust in the records, no small matter for a company like Borrow, which deals with such large volumes of money on the daily.
