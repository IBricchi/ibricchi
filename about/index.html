                    Currently I am starting my second year of undergraduate studies at Imperial College. I am 
                    studying Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE), an inbetween course between Electronic
                    Engineering and Computer Science.

                <p>
                    In my first year I achieved a "first", with recognition of the dean's list, meaning I scored
                    in the top 10% of students in my cohort. Furthermore, the final group project scorred top mark
                    and earned an award for best first year project.

                    As an Imperial EIE student, my course focuses on teaching the fundamental of computer-archetecture, and
                    low-level programming. In the first year we built a simple CPU design from scratch, aswell as created
                    programmes for it.
                </p>
                <h2>IB Diploma</h2>
                <p>
                    The International Bachaleaureate (IB) diploma is a highschool diploma, achnowledged ny many to be one
                    of the most rigurous internationalhighschool diplomans out there. I studdied 4 courses at higher level
                    (HL), this level covers university level material. The HL courses were Math, Physics, Chemistry, and
                    Economics. I recieved the scores of 7, 7, 7, and 6 respectfully for each of the courses, where 7 is the
                    highest mark achievable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At standard level (SL), a slightly lower level, pre-univiery level material, I studdied English Language
                    and Literature, and Spanish Language and Literature. This allowed me to receive a bi-lingual diploma
                    aknowledging my fluency in both English and Spanish. I receieved a 6, and a 5 respectfully for the courses. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Overall my diploma ended up with 40 points, with a maximum of 45 points. This includes the course points,
                    aswell as 2 of 3 points for the core IB programme, Theory of Knowledge (TOK), Creativity Activity Service
                    (CAS), and the Extended Essay (EE). TOK is a course about learning to learn, it encourages you to explore
                    what exactly knowledge is, and acts as a semi philopohy course. CAS is a requirement by the IB, to engage
                    not only in academics, but to do an Active, a Service, and a Cretaive activity throught the program.
                    Finally the EE, is a 4000 word investigation into a subject of choice. I chose chemistry, and explored
                    how different processes could increase the efficicency of the production of higdrogen through electrolysis.

                    OESIA is a multi-national coorperation based in Madrid Spain. During the summer
                    of 2018, I was employed there for an internship. My duties were to automate a system
                    for identifieng employees who's work could potentially apply for goverment sanctioned
                    tax-breaks for the company. The sytem would also allow for easy collection of data
                    to to proove that the employee did infact apply for tax-breaks, in the event of an audit.
                </p>
                <div class="auto-margin uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body uk-width-1-2@s uk-width-1-3@m uk-width-1-4l">

                <p>
                    The company had a heavy emphasis on inovation. The government of spain recenlty had
                    created a new law, decreasing the ammount of social-secuirty a company had to pay to the
                    government for workers who worked in a project which fell under certain guidelens to do with
                    techonolical inovation. As such the company, could largely benefit from taking advantage of
                    this law.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using a combination of data from human resources, employee work hours, project lists, etc.
                    I devised a system which would identify known emplyees who had already been marked as
                    able to take advantage of the new law, and through extrapolation found projects, which
                    could be considered "invoative", and generated a list of potential candidates.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This system massively decreased the list of potential candidates down to a managable list.
                    And sorted them from most-likely to apply to least likely. A human could go through, see the
                    evidence collected, recieve identification information to look for more proof, and then either
                    accept, or decline them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once in the system, automated emails would be sent to those who were deemed able to apply
                    for the tax cuts, to submit evidence of work. A small amount of checking was automated to
                    ensure that the information was valid, however, all information had to be vetted by someone,
                    just to ensure that there was valid proof of work.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Unfortunately I am unable to provide any of the code for this project, as I was not allowed to
                    keep a copy of it, nor would I have been allowed to publish it.

                    Borro, is a London based financial statrtup working with high value asset based lending.
                    Durring the summer of 2017 I was epmployed to run an experiment using blockchain as a
                    potential new financial ledger for the company. The technology would allow for permanent
                    financial records, it would increase trust in the records, and for a company dealing with
                    large assets such as Borro, increasing trust is no small matter.

                    Using multichain (a software which allows creation and usage of a block chain), I created
                    a small local blockchain server. Around it I created a webserver using Java, PHP, and JS, in
                    the end I created a simple web page which allowed a simple user interface to read, and write
                    into the financial ledger. It had querying abilities, for reading, and would check information
                    written into it before committing anything into the ledger, ensuring all information was
                    correct, as far as it could tell.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Towards the end of the project a small report was written on the findings, and in the end the
                    company decided not to go with the block chain proposal, the current system was good enough,
                    and it was deemed an unnessary addition.
                </p>

                    I am unable to share any of the code during the project due to not being able to take a copy, after
                    the internship.
