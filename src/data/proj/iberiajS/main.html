    iberiaJS started off as a simple project to help me develop this website you're currently reading.
    It quickly started growing, and as I handn't envisioned it as more than a tool for creating this
    website, it had odd semantics, non-consitent formatting etc. Certian functions simply could not
    be implemented due to the way I was parsing and more. I decided to create a new project to fix these
    issues. I create a consistent syntax, and re-implemented the code, with a cleaner API and more
    functional parsing. A lot of the execution code was the same, with minor changes here and there.

    Before starting this project I had been reaserching a lot to do with programming language design and creation
    I used this information to help me with iberia. The program has a parser (inspierd by the pratt top down)
    parsing algorithm) and what I call an executer, it runs similarly to an interpreter.

    As I was developing it with this website in mind, it currently lacks certain features, but I do plan on actively
    maintaing and expanding it. It's a project I very much enjoyed programming in, and I'm quite happy with the results.
