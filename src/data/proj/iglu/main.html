    iglu is a programming language I started developing during the summer of 2020. Coronavirus really gave me a
    lot of time to kill : ). Over the summer I read a book called Crafting interpreters, written by Bob Nystrom,
    it outlines two different interpreted languages and implements them. As I read and followed along with the book
    I started implementing my own language iglu. The project is still in it's infancy, developing a new language is
    a lot of work, and is completely different to anything I've ever done before.

    I've always wanted to create my own programming language, and I thought that this year would be a great
    time to give it a shot. The idea is to create a fully object oriented interpreted programming language,
    which can easily be extended in C++. My super long term goal with this language, is to eventually get it
    to a point where I can create complex systems, and create a custom web framework which can be used with
    iglu.
</p>

<p>
    The language is an object oriented dynamically typed interpreted language. Inspired by python, and javascript,
    it borrows syntax from both of these languages. Everything in the language is an object (even functions), and
    every operator is overloadable (even the call operator -still working on that part-). The language is meant to
    be as flexible as possible, restricting nothing from the user.
</p>

<p>
    Notable features the language already has:
    <ul>
        <li>Fundamental Types (Object, numbers, strings, bools, functions, etc.)</li>
        <li>Variable</li>
        <li>C++ iglu function interfacing</li>
        <li>Garbage collection</li>
        <li>Function based operators, with function calls on operators</li>
    </ul>

    Current development
    <ul>
        <li>General Function Calls</li>
        <li>Custom Function</li>
        <li>Scoping</li>
        <li>Loops</li>
        <li>Conditional statements</li>
    </ul>
