    LTS V2 is a transient circuit simulator created in C++ designed with ease of use and expandability in
    mind. Apart from the matrix library "Eigen3" everything was written by scratch. This project
    was my final submission for my univeristy course "EIE" at Imperial College of London. Two of
    my classmates and I formed a group to build a circuit simulator in C++. The assignment
    surpassed expectations and recieved a "first" which is the higest mark achieveable. On top of that it was
    awarded the prize of best group project of all first years.

    This was a school project so I had certain conditions that needed to be met concerning speed of
    exectution and accuracy of results (I have a nice long paper detailing our success with this, 
    but I can't publish it yet since it's still being moderated, I'll put a little link here when it's ready).
    On top of that I wanted the code to be expandable. Waht do I mean by that? Circuit simulators
    require compoennts to be modeled mathematically, however all of these models will unfortuantely have
    some imprecise nature to them, since they're models. This means that the default models supported
    by my program might not be what's required by the final user. Making the code expandable easily
    means that anyone can easily add they're own models and components and not have to worry about,
    the mathematics of the simulation.
</p>

<p>
    To achieve the expandability of the code polymorphic code was used. Every component is treated identically,
    and a few functions are used as an interface between the circuit (our name for the tranisnt analysis simulator)
    and the compoentns. This was mostly true, there were some cases where we added special treatement, but it was
    mostly for optimisation purposes.

    Normally I would've liked to put a picture of the group working here but unfortunately...
    well... Coronavirus so we didn't actually all work on it at the same time <b>*should've screenshoted
    a skype call oh well...*</b>
</div>

<p>
    You know how Coronavirus made life hard for everyone for some time (still is as of writing this) well, 
    it made this project a bit harder aswell. Everyone was at home, so it was a chalenge to work together,
    different time zones, different schedules, ect. As a result the code became a section of modules which
    each work together to form the final product. It ended up being very helpeful as each section is nearly
    independant from the rest so it can be developed and debugged independantly.
