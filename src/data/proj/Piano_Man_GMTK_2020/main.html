    PianoMan was my submission to the GMTK Game Jam for 2020. This was the largest purely online game Jam
    in history with over 18k participants, and over 5k sumbissions all developed in under 48 hours. It was
    my first time building a full game (if a game jam game can be considered a "full" game) with the Unity
    Game Engine. The game jam theme was:
</p>

<div class="auto-margin uk-card uk-card-default uk-card-body uk-width-1-2@s uk-width-1-3@m uk-width-1-4l">
    <video src="/src/data/proj/Piano_Man_GMTK_2020/gmtk2020.mp4" muted playsinline autoplay="1" alt="GMTK 2020 theme"></video>
    <span>Out Of Control</span>
</div>

<p>
    I took this theme and interpreted it in terms of how music makes people loose control. It was a really great
    experience and I'm very much looking forward to pariticpaiting in more game jams and hackathons in the future.

    One plays as a musitian with a piano. Enemies react based on the music that is being played, but you can take over
    with your own music. When you play the enemies who hear you play turn on eachother and act accordingly based on
    the song that you play. With this power you reach the end of each level and make a choice. These choices are then
    used to generate a unique 4 part composition based on your journey.

    In the game jam I recieved the following results:

    I received a lot of comments which really helped me learn from the experience. Some of it critical, such as that
    that the effect of the decisions wasn't very impactful, and the concept could've been put to better use or expanded.
    Some of it praising, for example the art style, something I'm very proud of, as it was the first time I dipped my
    toes in pixel art, and all art was made during the jam.
